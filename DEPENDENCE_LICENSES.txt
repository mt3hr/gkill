For the purposes of this definition,       "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the       direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or       otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the       outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.        "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity       exercising permissions granted by this License.        "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,       including but not limited to software source code, documentation       source, and configuration files.        "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical       transformation or translation of a Source form, including but       not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,       and conversions to other media types.        "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or       Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a       copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work       (an example is provided in the Appendix below).        "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object       form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the       editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications       represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes       of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain       separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,       the Work and Derivative Works thereof.        "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including       the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions       to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally       submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner       or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of       the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"       means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent       to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to       communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,       and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the       Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but       excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise       designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."        "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity       on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and       subsequently incorporated within the Work.     2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of       this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,       worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable       copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,       publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the       Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.     3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of       this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,       worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable       (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,       use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,       where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable       by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their       Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)       with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted.

Notwithstanding Section      2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a Contributor:       a. for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software; or       b. for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party窶冱         modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its         Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor         Version); or       c. under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of its         Contributions.

Subsequent Licenses       No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to      distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this License      (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if permitted      under the terms of Section 3.3).  2.5.

Fair Use       This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under applicable      copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other equivalents.  2.7. Conditions       Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted in      Section 2.1.   3. Responsibilities  3.1. Distribution of Source Form       All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any      Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under the      terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source Code Form      of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this License, and how      they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not attempt to alter or      restrict the recipients窶・rights in the Source Code Form.  3.2. Distribution of Executable Form       If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:       a. such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form,         as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the         Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by         reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost         of distribution to the recipient; and       b. You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this License,         or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the license for         the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients窶・        rights in the Source Code Form under this License.  3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work       You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,      provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for the      Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software      with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered      Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License permits      You to additionally distribute such Covered Software under the terms of      such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at      their option, further distribute the Covered Software under the terms of      either this License or such Secondary License(s).  3.4. Notices       You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices (including      copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations      of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the Covered      Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the extent      required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.  3.5. Application of Additional Terms       You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,      indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered      Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf      of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such      warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You      alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any      liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,      indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional      disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any      jurisdiction.  4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation     If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License    with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial    order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License    to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code    they affect. Such description must be placed in a text file included with all    distributions of the Covered Software under this License. Except to the    extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be    sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to    understand it.  5. Termination  5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You      fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant,      then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor      are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor      explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing basis,      if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by some      reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have come back into compliance.      Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are reinstated on an      ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by      some reasonable means, this is the first time You have received notice of      non-compliance with this License from such Contributor, and You become      compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt of the notice.  5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent      infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims,      and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or      indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and      all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this License      shall terminate.  5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user      license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been      validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to      termination shall survive termination.  6. Disclaimer of Warranty     Covered Software is provided under this License on an 窶彗s is窶・basis, without    warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including,    without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free of defects,    merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire    risk as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You.    Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You (not any    Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing, repair, or    correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of this    License. No use of  any Covered Software is authorized under this License    except under this disclaimer.  7. Limitation of Liability     Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including    negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who    distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any    direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any    character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of    goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all    other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been    informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability    shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from such    party窶冱 negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation.    Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or    consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.  8. Litigation     Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of    a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of business    and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without    reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall    prevent a party窶冱 ability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims.  9. Miscellaneous     This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter    hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such    provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it    enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a    contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not be used to construe    this License against a Contributor.   10. Versions of the License  10.1. New Versions        Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section       10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or       publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a       distinguishing version number.  10.2. Effect of New Versions        You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version of       the License under which You originally received the Covered Software, or       under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license       steward.  10.3. Modified Versions        If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to       create a new license for such software, you may create and use a modified       version of this License if you rename the license and remove any       references to the name of the license steward (except to note that such       modified license differs from this License).  10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary Licenses       If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With       Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the       notice described in Exhibit B of this License must be attached.

The contents           of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and           do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution           notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside           or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided           that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed           as modifying the License.

Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify       the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed       with Licensor regarding such Contributions.     6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade       names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,       except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the       origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.     7.

You are solely responsible for determining the       appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any       risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.     8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,       whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,       unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly       negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be       liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,       incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a       result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the       Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,       work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all       other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor       has been advised of the possibility of such damages.     9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing       the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,       and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,       or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this       License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only       on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf       of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,       defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability       incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason       of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

You may reproduce and distribute copies of the       Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without       modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You       meet the following conditions:        (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or           Derivative Works a copy of this License; and        (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices           stating that You changed the files; and        (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works           that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and           attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,           excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of           the Derivative Works; and        (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its           distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must           include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained           within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not           pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one           of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed           as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or           documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,           within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and           wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents           of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and           do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution           notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside           or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided           that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed           as modifying the License.

Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,       any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work       by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of       this License, without any additional terms or conditions.       Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify       the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed       with Licensor regarding such Contributions.     6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade       names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,       except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the       origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.     7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or       agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each       Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,       WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or       implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions       of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A       PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the       appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any       risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.     8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,       whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,       unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly       negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be       liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,       incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a       result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the       Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,       work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all       other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor       has been advised of the possibility of such damages.     9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing       the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,       and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,       or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this       License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only       on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf       of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,       defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability       incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason       of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

"Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object       form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the       editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications       represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes       of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain       separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,       the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and       may provide additional or different license terms and conditions       for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or       for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,       reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with       the conditions stated in this License.     5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,       any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work       by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of       this License, without any additional terms or conditions.       Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify       the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed       with Licensor regarding such Contributions.     6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade       names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,       except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the       origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.     7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or       agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each       Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,       WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or       implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions       of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A       PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the       appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any       risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.     8.

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing       the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,       and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,       or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this       License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only       on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf       of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,       defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability       incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason       of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

Subject to the terms and conditions of       this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,       worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable       copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,       publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the       Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.     3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of       this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,       worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable       (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,       use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,       where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable       by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their       Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)       with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You       institute patent litigation against any entity (including a       cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work       or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct       or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses       granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate       as of the date such litigation is filed.     4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the       Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without       modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You       meet the following conditions:        (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or           Derivative Works a copy of this License; and        (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices           stating that You changed the files; and        (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works           that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and           attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,           excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of           the Derivative Works; and        (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its           distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must           include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained           within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not           pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one           of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed           as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or           documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,           within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and           wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents           of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and           do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution           notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside           or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided           that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed           as modifying the License.        You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and       may provide additional or different license terms and conditions       for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or       for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,       reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with       the conditions stated in this License.     5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,       any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work       by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of       this License, without any additional terms or conditions.       Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify       the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed       with Licensor regarding such Contributions.     6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade       names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,       except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the       origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.     7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or       agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each       Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,       WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or       implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions       of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A       PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the       appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any       risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.     8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,       whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,       unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly       negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be       liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,       incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a       result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the       Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,       work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all       other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor       has been advised of the possibility of such damages.     9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing       the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,       and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,       or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this       License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only       on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf       of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,       defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability       incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason       of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

The contents           of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and           do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution           notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside           or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided           that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed           as modifying the License.

Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify       the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed       with Licensor regarding such Contributions.     6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade       names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,       except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the       origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.     7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or       agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each       Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,       WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or       implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions       of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A       PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the       appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any       risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.     8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,       whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,       unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly       negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be       liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,       incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a       result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the       Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,       work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all       other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor       has been advised of the possibility of such damages.     9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing       the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,       and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,       or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this       License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only       on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf       of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,       defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability       incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason       of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS     APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

=== [noms@0.0.0] ===

Repository: https://github.com/calvinmetcalf/noms

noms ====  create super easy readable-streams filled with yummy data to nom on, inspired by [from2](https://github.com/hughsk/from2) (and a test based on one from there).  ```bash npm install noms ```  ```js var noms = require('noms'); ```  Create a quick readable stream  ```js nom([options], read, [before]); ```  options is optional and passed to readable stream just like in from2 or through2  read is the main read function, it is similar to the original node streams but size is optional and a callback is passed.  It will NOT be called again until the callback is called.  before is called right before the first call to read in order to do setup, it is passed a callback and read will not be called until the callback is called.  like through2 and from2 noms also features  ```js nom.obj([options], read, [before]); ```  which is shorthand for creating an object stream and like from2 noms has  ```js noms.ctor(read, [before]); ```  which returns a constructor function for use if you're creating a large number of copies of the stream.  example (based on one from from2):  ```js function fromString(string) {   return noms(function(size, next) {     // if there's no more content     // left in the string, close the stream.     if (string.length <= 0) {       return this.push(null);     }      // Pull in a new chunk of text,     // removing it from the string.     var chunk = string.slice(0, size);     string = string.slice(size);      // Emit "chunk" from the stream.     next(null, chunk);   }) } ```  you can use `this.push(foo)` and `next(null, foo)` interchangeably, just remember to call next at the end.  ```js function fromString(string) {   return noms(function(size, next) {     // if there's no more content     // left in the string, close the stream.     if (string.length <= 0) {       return next(null, null);     }      // Pull in a new chunk of text,     // removing it from the string.     var chunk = string.slice(0, size);     string = string.slice(size);      // Emit "chunk" from the stream.     this.push(chunk);     // finish up     next();   }) } ```  If you don't care about size you can omit it  ```js function fromString(sentence) {   var strings = sentence.trim().split(/\s+/);   var i = -1;   var len = strings.length;   return noms(function(next) {     // if there's no more content     // left in the string, close the stream.     if (++i < len) {       return this.push(strings[i]);     } else {      return this.push(null);     }     next(); } ```  You don't have to worry about the response from this.push, as noms will call the function again after you call next until the cache is full.  ```js var fs = require('fs'); var path = require('path'); function getFiles(dir) {   var stack = [path.resolve(dir)];   return noms(function(next) {     if (!stack.length) {       //we are done       return next(null, null);     }     var self = this;     var current = stack.pop();     fs.readdir(current, function (err, paths) {       if (err) {         return next(err);       }       if (!paths.length) {         // this directory is empty         return next();       }      var todo = paths.length;      paths.forEach(function (file) {         var fullPath = path.join(current, file);         fs.stat(fullPath, function (err, stats) {           todo--;           if (err) {             return next(err);           }           if (stats.isFile()) {             //found a file             // emit it as data             self.push(fullPath);           } else if (stats.isDirectory()) {             // found another directory             // put it into the stack             // is depth first, switch this to             // a shift to make it breadth first             stack.push(fullPath);           }           if (!todo) {             // we've done all the files             // would be a lot simpler if I used promises             // would that help or hurt the example?             next();           }         });       });     });  } ```
